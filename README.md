# knockout-filelist
A simple asset list with sidebar using KnockoutJS and Bootstrap.

A nice little component that reads from an external .json file and renders the array in a list. You can select a row and show a 'sidebar' that can provide the user with more extended details on the selected row. You could easily add more data to the json and render it out on the sidebar.
