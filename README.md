# knockout-assetlist
A simple asset list with sidebar using <a href="http://knockoutjs.com/">KnockoutJS</a> and <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>.

A nice little component that reads from an external .json file and renders the array in a list. You can select a row and show a 'sidebar' that can provide the user with more extended details on the selected row. You could easily add more data to the json and render it out on the sidebar.
